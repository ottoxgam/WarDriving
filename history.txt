v1.1
Configuration removed from main bash script and placed in a separate file - WarDriving.cfg
This spares the user from having to re-enter their configuration details into the main bash script every time they upgrade or change versions.
An example configuration file is provided - WarDriving.cfg.example
If the user does not have an existing WarDriving.cfg file (i.e. first download and not an upgrade), then they should edit the example file before renaming it to WarDriving.cfg (i.e. cp WarDriving.cfg.example WarDriving.cfg)
